                      <p>All our try at home samples come in size 6.5 for engagement rings and can range to size 9 for
                        thicker bands. Unfortunately, we're not able to offer custom sizes at this moment, but most
                        people still find the service very helpful in assessing stone size, setting height, and overall
                        design. We recommend trying the ring on a different finger if it's a bit too small or big to get
                        a feel for how it fits.</p>

                        <br>

                        <br>
                        For more intricate, custom styles, we suggest setting aside 5-6 weeks for the design and making
                        process, and even more if you're envisioning something entirely out of the box. Patience pays

                        designers! Aim to start this exciting process about five weeks before your desired ring delivery

                        <br>
                        <strong>Collaborate over Email:</strong>
                        Your designer will work closely with you over email to bring your ring design to life through a
                        combination of reference photos and high-fidelity sketches.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Stone Selection Made Easy:</strong>
                        Once your ring design is solidified, your designer will curate a selection of stones for you to
                        choose from based on your quality preferences and budget. Our selection includes natural
                        diamonds, lab-grown diamonds, moissanite, and gemstones. Feel free to inspect stones in person
                        at our office or request additional photos and videos to aid in your decision-making.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Order Placement and 3D Model Creation:</strong>
                        After placing your order, we'll design a 3D model of your ring, a process that takes about a
                        week. Once ready, we'll send you a digital PDF for approval, complete with a rendering of your
                        ring. If you prefer a hands-on preview, we can also send a 3D printed plastic prototype for fit
                        testing and design preview.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Approval and Ring Production:</strong>
                        Once you give the green light to the CAD mockup, we'll make your ring! This typically takes
                        around three weeks, ensuring meticulous attention to detail in bringing your bespoke piece to
                        life.

                      <p>Each Frank Darling ring includes two rounds of complimentary minor revisions, allowing for
                        adjustments like band thickness, setting height, side stone size, and other details that do not
                        entail a complete overhaul of the CAD model.<br>
                        <br>
                        Should you completely change your mind, necessitating an entirely new CAD model, subsequent
                        models are $350. This covers the new ring design, a second fit sample, and two additional rounds
                        of revisions. Unfortunately, it's nonrefundable and can't be credited toward the final ring.

                        <br>
                        If you're feeling uncertain, we recommend talking to your designer about your concerns, and
                        going&nbsp;for the design you're most confident in — chances are you'll love it.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        If you don't, two rounds of minor revisions are included free of charge, and if you still hate
                        it, you can always opt to pull the trigger on that second model at a later point in time.

                        Unfortunately, at this point in time, we're no longer offering custom cut center stones due to
                        our inability to guarantee the exact grades post-certification.<br>

                        <strong>Side Stones:</strong><br>
                        We do offer custom cut side stones. The timeframe for these typically ranges from 2-8 weeks,
                        contingent on the type and availability of the rough material. Incorporating custom cut side
                        stones extends the overall production time to 5-13 weeks, depending on the project's complexity.
                        Currently, we can accommodate custom cut lab-grown diamond side stones and
                        gemstones.&nbsp;Custom cut side stones are eligible for return under our returns policy, with a
                        $250 restocking fee.

                      <p>We believe that your engagement ring should last you a lifetime of love. That’s why we
                        recommend picking stones that are rated 9 and up on the <a
                          href="https://frankdarling.com/blog/gemstone-hardness-scale-from-daily-durability-to-proceed-with-caution/">Mohs
                          Scale of Hardness</a>. This nifty scale grades gemstones on their ability to withstand
                        scratching on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being akin to the softness of&nbsp;chalk and 10 being
                        the hardest of the hard.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        And when it comes to hard, you can’t get much harder than diamonds. These beauties rank 10/10 on
                        the Mohs scale proving that nothing is quite as tough as a diamond. Not into diamonds? You have
                        options! Moissanite (9.5), sapphire (9), and ruby (also 9) all rank highly as well without
                        sacrificing on that ooh-la-la sparkle. Anything lower than 9 can run the risk of being scratched
                        during daily wear and tear which can result in higher costs down the road, not to mention

                      <p>We’re known for our light, airy bezels that balance durability with aesthetics. Our bezels
                        typically finish between .5mm and 1mm. However, the final bezel width is influenced by the size
                        of the center stone and can vary due to hand finishing. A general rule of thumb is the larger
                        the stone, the thicker the bezel.</p>

                      aria-label="Answer to: What's the thinnest band you offer?">
                      <p>Our thinnest band option is 1.5mm wide by 1.7mm tall. For diamonds and gemstones over 3 carats,
                        we recommend bumping the band thickness up to 1.8mm. This will proportionally give a similarly
                        thin look but is better suited to securely holding the center stone.<br>
                        <br>
                        While you might be tempted to go sleek and slender with a ring thinner than 1.5mm, it may not be
                        the wisest choice. Why? Well, anything less than 1.5mm will have a tough time holding up to the
                        daily wear and tear, and may result in your setting getting quite literally whacked out of shape
                        simply by just grabbing something a little too hard. So make sure your ring is at least 1.5mm or
                        larger. This way, it's bound to last through any champagne toasts, spontaneous dance parties,
                        and Insta-worthy moments you throw at it.

                      <p>Milgrain detailing on the bezel or band edges is done with a tiny toothed wheel, creating a

                        <br>
                        In contrast, milgrain on the prongs or basket is typically incorporated into the CAD design and
                        cast, as these areas are challenging to reach by hand. <br>
                        <br>
                        If you choose a custom setting, any milgrain featured in the CAD mockup will be cast, and any
                        milgrain not depicted will be meticulously applied by hand during the crafting process.

                      <p>When considering how high is too high-the sky really is the limit. Just be sure to remember
                        that Medium and High Profile rings are more prone to hitting more surfaces and thus are more
                        susceptible to damage.<br>
                        <br>
                        Another thing to consider? How often you find yourself using your hands in daily life so ask
                        yourself: are you wild with your hands? Do you tend to use them a lot in your day-to-day
                        activities? If the answer is a resounding yes, a low-profile ring may be the perfect setting for
                        you. After all, you want to show off that ring without the worry of it taking damage - ain't
                        nobody got time for that.&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        Ultimately, your perfect height is going to be a balance of form and functionality. Whether
                        you're reaching for the stars or keeping those feet on the ground, it's all about what makes you
                        feel the most fabulous while keeping your bling safe and protected, so trust your gut and go for
                        what feels right for you.

                        choose and why.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>1.5mm: Modern and minimal</strong><br>

                        Requires a bit more care to maintain its shape.<br>

                        <strong>1.8mm: Timeless and classic</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        Balances aesthetics and durability.<br>
                        Appears visually thin while providing support.<br>
                        A great choice if the absolute thinnest band isn't a top priority.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>2.0mm: A little something extra</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        More durable.<br>
                        Ideal for those seeking a more gold or pavé forward look.<br>
                        Provides extra security for larger stones.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>2mm+: Chunky and gold forward</strong><br>

                      <p>Well, here at Frank Darling, we care about the planet. So we use 100% recycled gold and
                        platinum for our jewelry. It’s reclaimed from post-consumer sources and re-refined. It’s exactly
                        the same as newly mined gold (yes, gold is mined out of the Earth just like diamonds!) without
                        the environmental damage. Our sources include recycled jewelry, industrial products, and
                        electronics.<br>
                        <br>
                        Our 18K rose gold is 75% gold, 24% copper, 1% silver with trace elements of zinc. The zinc
                        accentuates the color of the copper and gives it a lovely blush pink hue.<br>
                        <br>
                        Our 14K yellow gold alloy is 58% gold, 5% zinc, 5% silver, and 32% copper.<br>
                        <br>

                      aria-label="Answer to: Do you rhodium plate your white gold?">
                      <p>Yes, much like most fine jewelry, our white gold is plated with a thin layer of rhodium to give
                        the metal a bright, white gold.<br>
                        <br>
                        The downside of plating is that it doesn’t last forever. Sweat, wear and tear, chlorine, and
                        your natural body chemistry and PH balance will shorten the lifespan of the plating.<br>
                        <br>
                        Generally, rhodium plating lasts about 6 months, at which point the natural color of the white
                        gold will begin to show through. Part of caring for a white gold engagement ring is having it
                        replated, or dipped, every six months to one year. If this is something you're less than
                        thrilled with, you'll want to opt for platinum.<br>
                        <br>
                        If you'd prefer a more natural antique look to your white gold, let us know, and we can
                        generally accommodate!

                      <p>Generally, your pavé diamonds won't take a tumble unless you give your ring a good smack. But
                        hey, accidents happen, right?<br>
                        <br>
                        To be on the safe side, consider a pavé band that is one-half or three-quarter of the way around
                        the ring. It's a fabulous way to keep your pave in place while looking fierce.
                      </p>
                      <p><br>
                        Additionally, keep in mind that pavé diamonds on prongs are a little more delicate and
                        vulnerable, so just be sure to handle them with a little extra loving care to ensure longevity.

                      <p><strong>Bead-Set Pavé:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                        Bead set pavé uses small metal beads to secure the stones, accentuating their shapes. This
                        results in a durable, smooth surface that accentuates the shape of the individual stones. It's a
                        more casual look overall.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>French-Set Pavé:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                        In contrast, French-set pavé is a classic technique where pavé stones are secured with small
                        prongs. The surrounding metal is carefully cut away in a scalloped fashion, allowing more light
                        in. Searching for the brightest, diamond-forward look? This one's probably right for you!

                      <p>If you’re purchasing the bracelet for yourself, wrap a soft measuring tape around your wrist
                        and round up by .5” to the nearest half inch. The bracelet should be about .5” larger than your
                        wrist circumference. We don't offer quarter sizes, but we have half and whole sizes available!
                        <br>

                        If you're gifting the bracelet and unsure of the recipient's wrist size, 7 inches is a safe bet.
                        Adjustments can be made to lengthen or shorten the bracelet as long as you’re within our 30 day

                      <p>Frank Darling provides a lifetime warranty against manufacturing defects. This warranty does
                        not cover wear and tear and excludes the center stone. Please note that having your ring
                        serviced by a third-party jeweler will void this warranty.<br>
                        <br>
                        I﻿f a center stone is lost due to loose prongs, or damaged beyond repair, Frank Darling is not
                        liable for this loss.<br>
                        <br>
                        Not sure if your piece broke as a result of manufacturing defects or regular wear and tear? A
                        general rule of thumb — if your ring was damaged more than 6 months after purchase, it is
                        usually due to wear and tear and not a manufacturer’s issue. <br>
                        <br>
                        Most settings are damaged due to force being placed on the inner band, which can cause the ring
                        to bend and deform, leading to stones popping out. This is sometimes referred to as a ring going
                        "out of round," and can be avoided by taking the ring off when doing hand heavy activities.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Examples of manufacturing defects that result in broken rings can
                          include:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
                        <br>
                        💎 Stones that are loose even though they are set in a recently made ring&nbsp;<br>
                        💍 Newly-made rings that are deformed, bent&nbsp;or dented<br>
                        😲 Rings that are crooked<br>
                        🥇 Rings that were made with an incorrect material.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Our warranty does not cover rings that were broken due to regular wear and tear which

                        <br>
                        🧴 Discoloration due to exposure of chemicals&nbsp;<br>
                        💍 Deterioration of prongs and precious metals as a result of wear&nbsp;<br>
                        💎 Bent, caught, or worn-out prong (s) that have resulted in a loose or lost stone thanks to

                      <p>First things first, remember to breathe. A broken or damaged ring is stressful but you’ve got
                        this! We understand that there's nothing more devastating than a ring in need of repair, that's
                        why we offer a lifetime manufacturer's warranty that covers common jewelry issues caused by
                        manufacturing defects.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Follow these steps to initiate a repair:</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>C﻿ontact your insurer</strong><br>
                        If you're insured, contact your insurer to initiate a claim. Claims can take a bit of time to
                        process so it's best to get started ASAP.<br>

                          an appointment</a> to drop your ring off for repair. While we know you're eager for a
                        resolution, we need to have the ring in hand to evaluate what happened and provide guidance on
                        next steps. All production is coordinated through our NYC office, so rings dropped off at our
                        satellite showrooms will take additional time to process (usually around an extra 2-5 days
                        depending when they're dropped off).<br>

                        <strong>A﻿wait the inspection</strong><br>
                        A dedicated client care representative or designer will reach out to you within 48 hours of
                        arrival in NYC to discuss the necessary steps to fix your ring and set up a general guideline to
                        when you can expect its return,&nbsp;if it is covered under our warranty or care plan, and how
                        long the work will take to complete.<br>

                        R﻿epairs can take from seven business days on the short end to up to four weeks on the long end
                        for pieces that need to be fully remade. We'll let you know before beginning the work how long
                        it will take and any associated costs to eliminate unpleasant surprises and get the ring back on
                        your finger as soon, and securely, as possible.

                      <p>Absolutely. Insuring your ring provides you with the best security against loss or damage. It’s
                        also easy to get. Like, astoundingly easy. Many homeowner’s and renter’s insurance programs
                        offer engagement ring coverage up to a certain point; however, if you want to ensure full
                        coverage or just explore other options, consider shopping around to find insurance that matches
                        your budget as well as your needs. <br>
                        <br>
                        You can insure the ring through your homeowners or renters' policy. This is going to be the most
                        affordable but also the least exhaustive coverage. You can also insure it through a third-party
                        policy like&nbsp;<a href="https://my.jewelersmutual.com/jewelry-insurance-quote-apply">Jewelers
                          Mutual</a>. The rates are pretty standardized and around 1.8% of the value of the ring
                        annually. We recommend going with a jewelry-specific policy because the coverage is more
                        exhaustive.<br>

                        into your country after a repair. In this scenario, it's usually better to have the ring resized
                        locally. Frank Darling is not liable for any customs and duty charges in this scenario.

                      <p>You can exchange your tennis bracelet for a new size or color within 30 days of purchase. If
                        the bracelet you’re exchanging for is in stock, the process usually takes 7–10 business days. If
                        it’s not in stock, it may take up to three weeks. There’s no exchange fee—if the new bracelet
                        costs less, we’ll issue you a credit, and if it costs more, we’ll send an invoice for the

                        makes it impossible. As a result, these rings are eligible for one complimentary exchange under

                      <p>You can exchange your tennis bracelet for a new size or color within 30 days of purchase. If
                        the bracelet you’re exchanging for is in stock, the process usually takes 7–10 business days. If
                        it’s not in stock, it may take up to three weeks. There’s no exchange fee—if the new bracelet
                        costs less, we’ll issue you a credit, and if it costs more, we’ll send an invoice for the
                        difference. To get started, just email us at <a href="">hello@frankdarling.com</a></p>

                        beyond this puts the ring at risk of going out of round or stones popping out.</p>

                        As much as we wish we could resize certain rings like eternity bands, their unique structure
                        makes it impossible. As a result, these rings are eligible for one complimentary exchange under
                        our return policy.
